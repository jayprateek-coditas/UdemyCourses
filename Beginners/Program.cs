// Ex-1 => Input number in range 1 to 10
//Ex_1 e1 = new Ex_1();


// Ex-2 =>  Write a program which takes two numbers from the console and displays the maximum of the two.

//Ex_2 e2 = new Ex_2();

// Ex-3 Write a program and ask the user to enter the width and height of an image. Then tell if the image is landscape or portrait.

//Ex_3 e3 = new Ex_3();

// Ex-4 Write a program that asks the user to enter the speed limit. Once set, the program asks for the speed of a car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program should display Ok on the console. If the value is above the speed limit, the program should calculate the number of demerit points. For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points should be incurred and displayed on the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program should display License Suspended.

//Ex_4 e4 = new Ex_4();

// Ex-5 => Write a program to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3 with no remainder.Display the count on the console.

//Ex_5 e5 = new Ex_5();

// Ex-6 => Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter a number or "ok" to exit. Calculate the sum of all the previously entered numbers and display it on the console.

//Ex_6 e6 = new Ex_6();

// Ex-7 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a number. Compute the factorial of the number and print it on the console. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should calculate 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 and display it as 5! = 120.

//Ex_7 e7 = new Ex_7();

// Ex-8 => Write a program that picks a random number between 1 and 10. Give the user 4 chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number, display “You won"; otherwise, display “You lost". (To make sure the program is behaving correctly, you can display the secret number on the console first.)

//Ex_8 e8 = new Ex_8();

// Ex_8 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a series of numbers separated by comma. Find the maximum of the numbers and display it on the console. For example, if the user enters “5, 3, 8, 1, 4", the program should display 8.

//Ex_9  e9 = new Ex_9();

// Ex_9 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a series of numbers separated by comma. Find the maximum of the numbers and display it on the console. For example, if the user enters “5, 3, 8, 1, 4", the program should display 8.

//Ex_10 e10 = new Ex_10();

// Ex_10 => Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter different names, until the user presses Enter (without supplying a name). Depending on the number of names provided, display a message based on the above pattern.

//Ex_11 e11 = new Ex_11();

//Ex_11=> Write a program and ask the user to enter their name. Use an array to reverse the name and then store the result in a new string. Display the reversed name on the console.

//Ex_12 e12 = new Ex_12();

// Ex_12 => Write a program and ask the user to enter 5 numbers. If a number has been previously entered, display an error message and ask the user to re-try. Once the user successfully enters 5 unique numbers, sort them and display the result on the console.

//Ex_13 e13 = new Ex_13();

// Ex_13 => Write a program and ask the user to continuously enter a number or type "Quit" to exit. The list of numbers may include duplicates. Display the unique numbers that the user has entered.

//Ex_14 e14 =new Ex_14();

// Ex_14 => Write a program and ask the user to continuously enter a number or type "Quit" to exit. The list of numbers may include duplicates. Display the unique numbers that the user has entered.

//Ex_15 e15 =new Ex_15();
// Ex_15 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen. Work out if the numbers are consecutive. For example, if the input is "5-6-7-8-9" or "20-19-18-17-16", display a message: "Consecutive"; otherwise, display "Not Consecutive".

//Ex_16 e16 = new Ex_16();

//Ex_16 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen. If the user simply presses Enter, without supplying an input, exit immediately; otherwise, check to see if there are duplicates. If so, display "Duplicate" on the console.

//Ex_17 e17 = new Ex_17();

//Ex_17 => Write a program and ask the user to enter a time value in the 24-hour time format (e.g. 19:00). A valid time should be between 00:00 and 23:59. If the time is valid, display "Ok"; otherwise, display "Invalid Time". If the user doesn't provide any values, consider it as invalid time.

//Ex_18 e18 = new Ex_18();

//Ex_18 =>  Write a program and ask the user to enter a few words separated by a space. Use the words to create a variable name with PascalCase. For example, if the user types: "number of students", display "NumberOfStudents". Make sure that the program is not dependent on the input. So, if the user types "NUMBER OF STUDENTS", the program should still display "NumberOfStudents".

//Ex_19 e19 = new Ex_19();

//Ex_19 => Write a program and ask the user to enter an English word. Count the number of vowels (a, e, o, u, i) in the word. So, if the user enters "inadequate", the program should display 6 on the console.

//Ex_20 e20 = new Ex_20();

// Ex_20 => Write a program that reads a text file and displays the number of words.

Ex_21 e21 = new Ex_21(); 

// Ex_21 =>  Write a program that reads a text file and displays the longest word in the file.
